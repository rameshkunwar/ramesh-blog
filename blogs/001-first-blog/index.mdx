I would like to share the story behind this blog as my first blog. I would explain the various technologies I tried and failed and then found something and finally succeed.

## Why write a blog?

We can avoid many mistakes (sometimes foolish) in our lives, if we only use a few seconds to ask ourself, why? There should always be a logical reason for doing things. I want to share the knowledge I have gained and at the same time, I want to learn. Questions could be asked, why write a blog to learn? Yes, there is a point. But many times, learning once is not simply enough, maybe, I missed something, maybe I overlooked something. What if I were to teach the same thing to a group of people? How would I prepare for it?

> My motto here is not just to learn but to teach! Yes! therefore the motto of this blog is **_to teach is to learn twice_**.

## What to write?

A blog is nothing without content. As I wrote earlier, I will be sharing things that I have experienced and I have learned. I will be writing things, mostly, related to web & mobile development, design patterns, clean architecture, highly scalable & available systems design, and newly released interesting tools, technologies.

## Where to Write?

That was a very important and big question for me. One can start blogging within minutes on platform like [Medium](https://medium.com) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to). But I already had a site (boring) & domain, I thought, why not make my own? I am a developer and would love to get my hands dirty! WordPress, being a PHP oriented was a no-go (sorry).

I began looking for a .net-based CMS. I tried following CMSs.

> I had some constrained too. My web-hosting plan does not include a free MS-SQL and only 20 MB space.

- Umbraco: Great CMS which I am familiar with. I would have gone for it, had they supported MySQL (somewhere in 2019).
- Miniblog.Core: Mads Kristensen's [.net core blog template](https://github.com/madskristensen/Miniblog.Core). It was a good one but the UI was built with Razor pages. I wanted de-couple my front-end by using a JavaScript Framework from the back-end.
- Orchard Core: Very promising [CMS](http://www.orchardcore.net/) but I found it was too much for a blog, at least for me. Regardless, a very good framework as well as full, decoupled, and headless CMS.
- Strapi: This was the first time, I saw a CMS (headless) made in Javascript! I went through [Strapi](https://strapi.io) quickly, but then, I found something very interesting. There was no coming back to Strapi, sorry Strapi.

## Why Gatsby JS?

> _I instantly fell in love with Gatsby JS!_

Excellent documentation, excellent tutorials (this blog is made from scratch using (almost) Gatsby tutorial), a plugin for almost everything, great community support. I said earlier, I am a developer and want to get my hands dirty, Gatsby gave me a good opportunity. The greatest satisfaction came with the fact that I made this blog site almost from scratch! I, indeed, took some inspiration from other blogging sites.

- Performance: Being a static site generator, pages are served locally. No database involved. Further more, it loads **critical** parts of the page
- Markdown: Writing blog in markdown removes the burden of database & a text-editor!
- React: It is easier for me to create my own components.
- GraphQL: This is the biggest power of Gatsby. A bit complex to get through, but powerful to query data.
- Engaging: I am involved in every aspect of my blog (design, write, build, deploy). I can always add or modify feature.
- Quick development: As Gatsby has many plugins, it shortens the development time. Furthermore, there are many ready-made templates available.
- Typescript: Great for Typescript lover. At some point of time, I am gonna re-write this blog in Typescript.

> Warning! The caveat of ready-made templates!

In the beginning, I tried to use some templates to shorten my development time. I never worked with Gatsby before, however, I thought I could do it. That was a mistake. I end up losing the time, I wanted to save :-(. Gatsby has an excellent tutorial, going through it not only makes one better in understanding Gatsby but also gives a pleasure of building one's blog or site.

## What now?

Well, I dreamed of starting my blog since 2019. Tried many things but in the end, came up with a blog, albeit late, in September 2020! But now, I have a platform ready. I just need to write. My [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) list shows 11 topics, ready to write. I will try my best to write one blog every week, short or long.

I hope this will be a very interesting journey.
